# PlanAndTrack

- A web application to plan and track your daily life.
- An advanced event planner that checks if your planned schedule and activities have a healthy balance (meet your social, academic, health goals). 
- It also suggests events/places to go to by typed-in keywords

## Key features:

An integration of [bullet journalling](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn) and planning and tracking timelines.

-   Users have their own accounts
    
-   Users can brain dump all their tasks, events, reminders, to yearly, monthly, weekly, daily spread
    
-   Users plan their day based on a timeline
    

-   Users track their day on another timeline
    
-   Visualizatized comparison of their planned day and tracked day


- Functions like a event planner for the minimum, but additionally:
-   Gives you warnings when you need to move more (when the app sees that you have no exercise events planned in the week)
-   your schedule is messed up (when the app sees that you plan things at 3am)
-   you’re not having a healthy diet (this requires user to input their food plan in addition to event plans)
-   To simplify the process of looking up events online,
-   Suggests activities to do nearby on the map when user looks up tags or keywords 
- An example:  suggest nearby libraries and study places if user looks up “study”
- An example:  suggest nearby parks/marathon events when user looks up “outdoor” or type in “marathon”

## Why do I want to build this?

-   To add a full-stack web project on my resume.
    

After some research, I found that MERN is the most popular combo of full-stack development tools. I want to get some hands-on practice from this project.

-   The idea is kind of new?
    

Although there are countless to-do list, planner, and tracker apps out on the market, I haven’t found one that can plan and track

  

## Goal

Build this until I actually use it on a daily basis.
