## Why do I want to build this?

-   To add a full-stack web project on my resume.
    

After some research, I found that MERN is the most popular combo of full-stack development tools. I want to get some hands-on practice from this project.

-   The idea is kind of new?
    

Although there are countless to-do list, planner, and tracker apps out on the market, I havenâ€™t found one that can plan and track

  

## Goal

Build this until I actually use it on a daily basis.
